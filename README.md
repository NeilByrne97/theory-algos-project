## Introduction to SHA512

This Standard specifies secure hash algorithms, SHA-512. This algorithms is iterative, one-way hash
functions that can process a message to produce a condensed representation called a message
digest. This algorithms enables the determination of a messageâ€™s integrity: any change to the
message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This property is
useful in the generation and verification of digital signatures and message authentication codes,
and in the generation of random numbers or bits. 

## What is SHA512 used for?

This algorithm can be described in two stages: preprocessing and hash computation.
Preprocessing involves padding a message, parsing the padded message into m-bit blocks, and
setting initialization values to be used in the hash computation. The hash computation generates
a message schedule from the padded message and uses that schedule, along with functions,
constants, and word operations to iteratively generate a series of hash values. The final hash
value generated by the hash computation is used to determine the message digest. 
 
## How the program works

**SHA512**

SHA512 uses six logical functions, where each function operates on 32-bit
words, which are represented as x, y, and z. The result of each function is a new 32-bit word.
